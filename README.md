### bear148
I currently work on projects, CheeseBot, and [BMM](https://github.com/bear148/Bears-Mod-Manager). I primarily utilize Javascript, Powershell, and Rust.

### BMM
Currently working on a large update that finishes and adds more to the minecraft mod management system. That is why it hasn't received any commits.
